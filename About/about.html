        <h2>How It Started</h2>
        <p>
          I‚Äôm <b>Abhay Verma</b>, a Class 10 student who noticed a big problem ‚Äî most CGBSE students don‚Äôt have access to reliable, syllabus-aligned digital learning tools.
          Government apps like DIKSHA often lags, and private tuitions aren‚Äôt affordable for everyone & unreachable for most of the rural settlements.
          That‚Äôs where <b>Querent.AI</b> comes in.
        </p>

        <h2>The Vision</h2>
        <p>
          Querent.AI is my personal project ‚Äî a <b>prototype</b> built to reimagine how students learn in Chhattisgarh.
          It combines syllabus-based lessons, gamified learning, and an AI tutor that actually understands the CGBSE syllabus.
          The goal? To make quality education available to every student, no matter where they live.
        </p>

        <h2>What Makes Querent.AI Different</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Structured Learning:</b> Lessons mapped directly to the CGBSE syllabus.</li>
          <li><b>Gamified Motivation:</b> XP, streaks, and leaderboards make studying fun.</li>
          <li><b>AI Tutor (RAG-powered):</b> Uses textbook PDFs for accurate, syllabus-grounded answers.</li>
          <li><b>Accessibility:</b> Runs smoothly on affordable smartphones.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Not Just Use ChatGPT or Gemini?</h2>
        <p>
          Generic chatbots often <b>hallucinate</b>, lack syllabus awareness, and give inconsistent or overly complex answers.
          Querent.AI solves that by grounding every response in verified CGBSE material ‚Äî so students always get accurate, relevant help.
        </p>

        <h2>Current Phase</h2>
        <p>
          We‚Äôre currently in the <b>prototype phase</b>, focusing on Class 10 Science (Physics, Chemistry & Biology).
          The goal is to expand into more subjects and bring a truly personalized learning experience to all CGBSE students.
